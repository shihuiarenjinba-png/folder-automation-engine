## Not yet verified

- Launch from the Windows Start menu.
- Installed-package Japanese/English UI, setting persistence, close/restart, and real safe input/output.
- Installed-package Store screenshots.

The first Scheduled API Runner install attempt failed with `0x800B0109` because the test certificate is not in `LocalMachine\\TrustedPeople`. No certificate-store change is authorized by this document. Never use `CurrentUser\\Root` or `LocalMachine\\Root`, and never weaken Windows security controls.

Installed-package copy, move, monitoring, collision/no-overwrite behavior, settings persistence, and restart remain to be tested in a disposable folder.

Store submission, publication, main/release merge, external account access, and destructive customer-data operations are not authorized by this status note.
