# Consumer -2 isolated sales-prep / migration handoff

Date: 2026-10-24 (Asia/Tokyo)
Source staging repository: shihuiarenjinba-png/folder-automation-engine
Source branch: codex/consumer-v2-store-prep-20261024
Target public EMPTY repository: shihuiarenjinba-png/Folder-Automation-Engine-2

## Status and work done
Folder chooser is read-only, file-type quick examples are optional, custom filename glob remains available, preset change revokes prior preview. Reuse stable copy/move/watcher safety engine. Before release add true per-file undo/restore with collision-safe provenance and tests; avoid deleting originals by default.

## Sales and integrity HOLD
Real Windows 1024x768 / 1280x720 UI, symlink acceptance, stop/start watcher, file locked/in-progress downloads, collision and restore tests. The new -2 Store Identity/PFN/Store ID must be verified independently; do NOT reuse old product identity.

The target repository has no initial commit. Never commit directly to main/release; code owner must bootstrap a nonmain branch in the target repository and then port the reviewed source. A staged branch on the old repo is not the -2 production repository. No Partner Center identity has been independently established for the -2 product. Do not build or upload a -2 MSIX with the old product's Identity / Store ID. No merge, signature, paid CI, submission or publication approval is given.

## Required release sequence
1. Create nonmain work branch on target -2 repository, port code and tests without replacing original.
2. Confirm the real user-visible features; do not advertise unimplemented integrations or AI.
3. Windows CI: Python tests, EXE self-test and unpacked runtime test at exact HEAD.
4. Independent Partner Center -2 product reservation, Identity/Publisher/PFN/version verification. Unknown => HOLD.
5. Build Store QA_UNSIGNED candidate only when Identity is documented; validate manifest, EXE and MSIX hashes and artifacts.
6. Windows installed application checks, screenshots at 1024x768 / 1280x720, privacy, error recovery, certification checks.
7. Only after explicit approval, submit to Partner Center and publish.
